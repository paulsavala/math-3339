## Instructions

This homework is meant to be completed **with AI assistance** (such as an in-browser LLM like ChatGPT, and/or using a CLI like Claude Code) to practice scaling your data exploration work.

For all questions, submit:

1. Your code (in a `.py` file or Jupyter notebook)
2. All visualizations generated
3. Written answers to interpretation questions (can be in markdown or comments)
4. The prompts you used with the AI assistant(s)

### Dataset

You'll be working with a dataset called `housing_data.csv` which contains information about houses sold in various cities. The dataset includes:

- `price`: Sale price in dollars
- `square_feet`: Size of the house
- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms
- `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms
- `year_built`: Year the house was built
- `city`: City where the house is located
- `lot_size`: Size of the lot in square feet
- `garage_spaces`: Number of garage spaces
- `has_pool`: Whether the house has a pool (True/False)

---

## Questions

### Question 0:
- Which LLM assistant(s) did you use? Be specific. For example, "I used ChatGPT in the browser", or "I used Claude Code in the terminal". 

### Question 1 (5 points)

Use AI to create a comprehensive data profile that includes:

- Summary statistics for ALL numerical columns (not just price)
- Value counts for ALL categorical columns
- A report on missing values (which columns, how many, what percentage)
- Identification of potential outliers in numerical columns (using percentile method: values below 1st or above 99th percentile)

**Deliverables:**

- The prompt(s) you used
- The code generated
- The output/report

---

### Question 2 (5 points)

Prompt the AI to create a function that generates a complete set of univariate visualizations for the dataset. This should include:

- Histograms for all numerical columns
- Bar plots for all categorical columns
- All plots should be saved to a folder called `univariate_plots/`
- Each plot should have proper labels and titles

Run the function and submit all generated plots along with your code.

**Deliverables:**

- The prompt(s) you used
- The code
- All generated visualizations

---

### Question 3 (5 points)

Use AI to create a pair plot (using `sns.pairplot()`) showing relationships between key numerical variables: `price`, `square_feet`, `bedrooms`, and `year_built`. Color the points by `city`.

Based on the pair plot, answer:

- Which pair of variables shows the strongest visual relationship?
- Are there any variables that don't seem to relate to price?
- Do you notice any city-specific patterns?

**Deliverables:**

- The prompt(s) you used
- The pair plot visualization
- Your written interpretation (3-4 sentences)

---

### Question 4 (6 points)

Prompt the AI to create a function that compares price distributions across different subgroups. Specifically:

- Compare price by city
- Compare price by number of bedrooms
- Compare price by whether the house has a pool
- Generate both statistical summaries AND visualizations (box plots or violin plots)

Run this function and write 2-3 paragraphs interpreting the results. What insights did you gain about what drives housing prices?

**Deliverables:**

- The prompt(s) you used
- The code
- All visualizations
- Your written interpretation

---

### Question 5 (6 points)

Ask the AI to help you identify potential outliers in the `price` column. Your approach should:

- Define outliers as values below the 1st percentile or above the 99th percentile
- Create visualizations showing the distribution with outliers highlighted
- Display summary statistics for the full dataset and for data excluding outliers
- Investigate the outliers: are they data errors or legitimate expensive/cheap houses?

How many potential outliers did you identify? Should they be removed, or do they represent legitimate data points? Justify your answer.

**Deliverables:**

- The prompt(s) you used
- The code
- Visualizations showing outliers
- Written analysis (4-5 sentences)

---

### Question 6 (6 points)

Use AI to create a comprehensive test suite for the housing dataset. Your test suite should include at least 5 unit tests that check:

- Data types are correct
- No negative values in columns where they don't make sense (price, square_feet, etc.)
- Dates are within reasonable ranges (year_built should be between 1800 and 2024)
- Categorical values are from expected sets (cities should only be from a known list)
- No duplicate rows

Run all tests and report which (if any) failed.

**Deliverables:**

- The prompt(s) you used
- The complete test suite code
- Test results

---

### Question 7 (5 points)

Prompt the AI to create multiple scatter plots exploring the relationship between price and other numerical variables. You should generate:

- Price vs. square_feet (colored by city)
- Price vs. year_built (colored by has_pool)
- Price vs. lot_size (with a trend line)
- Price_per_sqft vs. bedrooms (colored by city)

For each plot, write 1-2 sentences describing what you observe.

**Deliverables:**

- The prompt(s) you used
- All scatter plots
- Your written observations

---

### Question 8 (6 points)

Use AI to create a function that systematically explores how price relates to ALL categorical variables in the dataset. For each categorical variable, the function should:

- Create a bar plot showing average price by category
- Generate a box plot showing the distribution of prices across categories
- Calculate and display summary statistics (mean, median, count) for each category
- Save all plots to a folder called `categorical_analysis/`

Run this function and write a paragraph identifying which categorical variables seem most important in determining house prices.

**Deliverables:**

- The prompt(s) you used
- The function code
- All generated visualizations
- Your written analysis

---

### Question 9 (6 points)

Use AI to create a function that performs a complete exploratory data analysis for ANY numerical column in the dataset. The function should:

- Take a DataFrame and column name as inputs
- Generate: histogram, box plot, and summary statistics
- Identify potential outliers using percentiles (values below 1st or above 99th percentile)
- Create a markdown-formatted report with findings
- Save all plots to a specified folder

Run this function on three different columns: `price`, `square_feet`, and `lot_size`.

**Deliverables:**

- The prompt(s) you used
- The function code
- All generated visualizations
- The markdown reports for each column

---

### Question 10 (7 points)

For this final question, ask the AI to help you create a comprehensive EDA report. This should be a multi-page visualization that includes:

- Overall dataset summary (rows, columns, missing values)
- Distribution plots for key numerical variables
- Correlation analysis
- Price analysis by different categorical variables
- Any interesting patterns or anomalies you discovered

Write a 1-page executive summary (300-400 words) that you would present to a stakeholder who doesn't know anything about data science. Explain:

- What the dataset contains
- Key findings from your analysis
- What factors seem most important in determining house prices
- Any data quality issues or limitations
- Recommendations for next steps

**Deliverables:**

- The prompt(s) you used
- All visualizations in your EDA report
- Your executive summary
- Reflection: How did using AI change your approach to this comprehensive analysis compared to doing it by hand?

---

## Submission Guidelines

Submit a ZIP file containing one folder for each problem. Within each folder you should have one file for each of the following:

1. **Code files:** All `.py` files or Jupyter notebooks
2. **Visualizations folder:** All plots and charts generated
3. **Written responses:** A single document (PDF or Markdown) with all your written answers, interpretations, and AI prompts used
4. **Data:** Include your cleaned/modified datasets if you created any

## Tips for Success

- Write specific, detailed prompts
- If the AI's first attempt isn't quite right, refine your prompt
- Always review and test the AI-generated code
- Don't just accept AI output—understand what it's doing
- Include context in your prompts (e.g., "I'm working with a housing dataset with columns...")

### General:

- Start early—EDA often reveals unexpected issues that take time to address
- Your interpretations are just as important as your code
- If you find something interesting in the data, explore it further!
- Use your brain. That's what it's there for.
