## Instructions

This homework is meant to be completed **with AI assistance** (such as an in-browser LLM like ChatGPT, and/or using a CLI like Claude Code) to practice scaling your data exploration work.

For all questions, submit:

1. Your code (in a `.py` file or Jupyter notebook)
2. All visualizations generated
3. Written answers to interpretation questions (can be in markdown or comments)
4. The prompts you used with the AI assistant(s)

### Dataset

You'll be working with the **California Housing Dataset**, which contains information about California census block groups. You should load it using `sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing` and then create a Pandas DataFrame with the feature columns plus the target.

**Data Set Characteristics:**

- Number of Instances: 20640
- Number of Attributes: 8 numeric, predictive attributes and the target

**Attribute Information:**

- `MedInc`: Median income in block group
- `HouseAge`: Median house age in block group
- `AveRooms`: Average number of rooms per household
- `AveBedrms`: Average number of bedrooms per household
- `Population`: Block group population
- `AveOccup`: Average number of household members
- `Latitude`: Block group latitude
- `Longitude`: Block group longitude

**Target Variable:**

- `MedHouseVal`: Median house value for California districts, expressed in hundreds of thousands of dollars ($100,000).

**Notes:**

- This dataset comes from the StatLib repository: https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html
- This dataset was derived from the 1990 U.S. census and uses one row per census block group.
- A block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people.
- Since rooms/bedrooms are averages per household, some values can be surprisingly large.
- Missing Attribute Values: None

Use the following code to load the dataset into a DataFrame named `df`:

```{python}
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
import pandas as pd

housing = fetch_california_housing(as_frame=True)
df = housing.frame
df.head()
```

## Questions

### Question 0:
- Which LLM assistant(s) did you use? Be specific. For example, "I used ChatGPT in the browser", or "I used Claude Code in the terminal". 

### Question 1 (5 points)

Use AI to create a comprehensive data profile that includes:

- Summary statistics for ALL numerical columns (including the target)
- A report on missing values (which columns, how many, what percentage)
- Identification of potential outliers in numerical columns (using percentile method: values below 1st or above 99th percentile)

**Deliverables:**

- The prompt(s) you used
- The code generated
- The output/report

---

### Question 2 (5 points)

Prompt the AI to create a function that generates a complete set of univariate visualizations for the dataset. This should include:

- Histograms for all numerical columns (including the target)
- All plots should be saved to a folder called `univariate_plots/`
- Each plot should have proper labels and titles

Run the function and submit all generated plots along with your code.

**Deliverables:**

- The prompt(s) you used
- The code
- All generated visualizations

---

### Question 3 (5 points)

Use AI to create a pair plot (using `sns.pairplot()`) showing relationships between key numerical variables: `MedHouseVal`, `MedInc`, `HouseAge`, and `AveRooms`. Color the points by **binned** `MedHouseVal` (for example, low/medium/high using `pd.qcut`).

Based on the pair plot, answer:

- Which pair of variables shows the strongest visual relationship?
- Are there any variables that don't seem to relate to `MedHouseVal`?
- Do you notice any differences across the low/medium/high value groups?

**Deliverables:**

- The prompt(s) you used
- The pair plot visualization
- Your written interpretation (3-4 sentences)

---

### Question 4 (6 points)

Prompt the AI to create a function that compares `MedHouseVal` distributions across different subgroups. Specifically:

- Compare `MedHouseVal` by **binned `MedInc`** (e.g., low/medium/high)
- Compare `MedHouseVal` by **binned `HouseAge`** (e.g., 0-10, 10-30, 30+)
- Compare `MedHouseVal` by **latitude region** (e.g., North/Central/South using cutoffs)
- Generate both statistical summaries AND visualizations (box plots or violin plots)

Run this function and write 2-3 paragraphs interpreting the results. What insights did you gain about what drives housing values?

**Deliverables:**

- The prompt(s) you used
- The code
- All visualizations
- Your written interpretation

---

### Question 5 (6 points)

Ask the AI to help you identify potential outliers in the `MedHouseVal` column. Your approach should:

- Define outliers as values below the 1st percentile or above the 99th percentile
- Create visualizations showing the distribution with outliers highlighted
- Display summary statistics for the full dataset and for data excluding outliers
- Investigate the outliers: are they data errors or legitimate expensive/cheap houses?

How many potential outliers did you identify? Should they be removed, or do they represent legitimate data points? Justify your answer.

**Deliverables:**

- The prompt(s) you used
- The code
- Visualizations showing outliers
- Written analysis (4-5 sentences)

---

### Question 6 (6 points)

Use AI to create a comprehensive test suite for the housing dataset. Your test suite should include at least 5 unit tests that check:

- Data types are correct
- No negative values in columns where they don't make sense (`MedInc`, `AveRooms`, `AveBedrms`, `Population`, `AveOccup`)
- Reasonable ranges for geographic coordinates (Latitude between 32 and 42, Longitude between -125 and -114)
- Reasonable ranges for `HouseAge` (e.g., 0 to 100)
- No duplicate rows

Run all tests and report which (if any) failed.

**Deliverables:**

- The prompt(s) you used
- The complete test suite code
- Test results

---

### Question 7 (5 points)

Prompt the AI to create multiple scatter plots exploring the relationship between `MedHouseVal` and other numerical variables. You should generate:

- `MedHouseVal` vs. `MedInc` (colored by `Latitude`)
- `MedHouseVal` vs. `HouseAge` (colored by binned `HouseAge`)
- `MedHouseVal` vs. `AveRooms` (with a trend line)
- `MedHouseVal` vs. `AveOccup` (colored by `Longitude`)

For each plot, write 1-2 sentences describing what you observe.

**Deliverables:**

- The prompt(s) you used
- All scatter plots
- Your written observations

---

### Question 8 (6 points)

Use AI to create a function that systematically explores how `MedHouseVal` relates to **engineered categorical variables** created from numeric columns. For each engineered categorical variable, the function should:

- Create a bar plot showing average `MedHouseVal` by category
- Generate a box plot showing the distribution of `MedHouseVal` across categories
- Calculate and display summary statistics (mean, median, count) for each category
- Save all plots to a folder called `categorical_analysis/`

Use at least three engineered categories such as:

- `MedInc` binned into low/medium/high
- `HouseAge` binned into 3-4 groups
- `Latitude` binned into North/Central/South

Run this function and write a paragraph identifying which engineered categories seem most important in determining house values.

**Deliverables:**

- The prompt(s) you used
- The function code
- All generated visualizations
- Your written analysis

---

### Question 9 (6 points)

Use AI to create a function that performs a complete exploratory data analysis for ANY numerical column in the dataset. The function should:

- Take a DataFrame and column name as inputs
- Generate: histogram, box plot, and summary statistics
- Identify potential outliers using percentiles (values below 1st or above 99th percentile)
- Create a markdown-formatted report with findings
- Save all plots to a specified folder

Run this function on three different columns: `MedHouseVal`, `MedInc`, and `AveRooms`.

**Deliverables:**

- The prompt(s) you used
- The function code
- All generated visualizations
- The markdown reports for each column

---

### Question 10 (7 points)

For this final question, ask the AI to help you create a comprehensive EDA report. This should be a multi-page visualization that includes:

- Overall dataset summary (rows, columns, missing values)
- Distribution plots for key numerical variables
- Correlation analysis
- `MedHouseVal` analysis by different engineered categorical variables
- Any interesting patterns or anomalies you discovered

Write a 1-page executive summary (300-400 words) that you would present to a stakeholder who doesn't know anything about data science. Explain:

- What the dataset contains
- Key findings from your analysis
- What factors seem most important in determining house values
- Any data quality issues or limitations
- Recommendations for next steps

**Deliverables:**

- The prompt(s) you used
- All visualizations in your EDA report
- Your executive summary
- Reflection: How did using AI change your approach to this comprehensive analysis compared to doing it by hand?
