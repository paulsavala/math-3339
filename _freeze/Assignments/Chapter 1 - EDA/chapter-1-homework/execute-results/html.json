Your code (in a `.py` file or Jupyter notebook)\n2. All visualizations generated\n3. Written answers to interpretation questions (can be in markdown or comments)\n4. The prompts you used with the AI assistant(s)\n\n### Dataset\n\nYou'll be working with a dataset called `housing_data.csv` which contains information about houses sold in various cities. The dataset includes:\n\n- `price`: Sale price in dollars\n- `square_feet`: Size of the house\n- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms\n- `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms\n- `year_built`: Year the house was built\n- `city`: City where the house is located\n- `lot_size`: Size of the lot in square feet\n- `garage_spaces`: Number of garage spaces\n- `has_pool`: Whether the house has a pool (True/False)\n\n---\n\n## Questions\n\n### Question 0:\n- Which LLM assistant(s) did you use? Be specific. For example, \"I used ChatGPT in the browser\", or \"I used Claude Code in the terminal\". \n\n### Question 1 (5 points)\n\nUse AI to create a comprehensive data profile that includes:\n\n- Summary statistics for ALL numerical columns (not just price)\n- Value counts for ALL categorical columns\n- A report on missing values (which columns, how many, what percentage)\n- Identification of potential outliers in numerical columns (using percentile method: values below 1st or above 99th percentile)\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n- The prompt(s) you used\n- The code generated\n- The output/report\n\n---\n\n### Question 2 (5 points)\n\nPrompt the AI to create a function that generates a complete set of univariate visualizations for the dataset. This should include:\n\n- Histograms for all numerical columns\n- Bar plots for all categorical columns\n- All plots should be saved to a folder called `univariate_plots/`\n- Each plot should have proper labels and titles\n\nRun the function and submit all generated plots along with your code.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n- The prompt(s) you used\n- The code\n- All generated visualizations\n\n---\n\n### Question 3 (5 points)\n\nUse AI to create a pair plot (using `sns.pairplot()`) showing relationships between key numerical variables: `price`, `square_feet`, `bedrooms`, and `year_built`. Color the points by `city`.\n\nBased on the pair plot, answer:\n\n- Which pair of variables shows the strongest visual relationship?\n- Are there any variables that don't seem to relate to price?\n- Do you notice any city-specific patterns?\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n- The prompt(s) you used\n- The pair plot visualization\n- Your written interpretation (3-4 sentences)\n\n---\n\n### Question 4 (6 points)\n\nPrompt the AI to create a function that compares price distributions across different subgroups. Specifically:\n\n- Compare price by city\n- Compare price by number of bedrooms\n- Compare price by whether the house has a pool\n- Generate both statistical summaries AND visualizations (box plots or violin plots)\n\nRun this function and write 2-3 paragraphs interpreting the results. What insights did you gain about what drives housing prices?\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n- The prompt(s) you used\n- The code\n- All visualizations\n- Your written interpretation\n\n---\n\n### Question 5 (6 points)\n\nAsk the AI to help you identify potential outliers in the `price` column. Your approach should:\n\n- Define outliers as values below the 1st percentile or above the 99th percentile\n- Create visualizations showing the distribution with outliers highlighted\n- Display summary statistics for the full dataset and for data excluding outliers\n- Investigate the outliers: are they data errors or legitimate expensive/cheap houses?\n\nHow many potential outliers did you identify? Should they be removed, or do they represent legitimate data points? Justify your answer.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n- The prompt(s) you used\n- The code\n- Visualizations showing outliers\n- Written analysis (4-5 sentences)\n\n---\n\n### Question 6 (6 points)\n\nUse AI to create a comprehensive test suite for the housing dataset. Your test suite should include at least 5 unit tests that check:\n\n- Data types are correct\n- No negative values in columns where they don't make sense (price, square_feet, etc.)\n- Dates are within reasonable ranges (year_built should be between 1800 and 2024)\n- Categorical values are from expected sets (cities should only be from a known list)\n- No duplicate rows\n\nRun all tests and report which (if any) failed.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n- The prompt(s) you used\n- The complete test suite code\n- Test results\n\n---\n\n### Question 7 (5 points)\n\nPrompt the AI to create multiple scatter plots exploring the relationship between price and other numerical variables. You should generate:\n\n- Price vs. square_feet (colored by city)\n- Price vs. year_built (colored by has_pool)\n- Price vs. lot_size (with a trend line)\n- Price_per_sqft vs. bedrooms (colored by city)\n\nFor each plot, write 1-2 sentences describing what you observe.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n- The prompt(s) you used\n- All scatter plots\n- Your written observations\n\n---\n\n### Question 8 (6 points)\n\nUse AI to create a function that systematically explores how price relates to ALL categorical variables in the dataset. For each categorical variable, the function should:\n\n- Create a bar plot showing average price by category\n- Generate a box plot showing the distribution of prices across categories\n- Calculate and display summary statistics (mean, median, count) for each category\n- Save all plots to a folder called `categorical_analysis/`\n\nRun this function and write a paragraph identifying which categorical variables seem most important in determining house prices.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n- The prompt(s) you used\n- The function code\n- All generated visualizations\n- Your written analysis\n\n---\n\n### Question 9 (6 points)\n\nUse AI to create a function that performs a complete exploratory data analysis for ANY numerical column in the dataset. The function should:\n\n- Take a DataFrame and column name as inputs\n- Generate: histogram, box plot, and summary statistics\n- Identify potential outliers using percentiles (values below 1st or above 99th percentile)\n- Create a markdown-formatted report with findings\n- Save all plots to a specified folder\n\nRun this function on three different columns: `price`, `square_feet`, and `lot_size`.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n- The prompt(s) you used\n- The function code\n- All generated visualizations\n- The markdown reports for each column\n\n---\n\n### Question 10 (7 points)\n\nFor this final question, ask the AI to help you create a comprehensive EDA report. This should be a multi-page visualization that includes:\n\n- Overall dataset summary (rows, columns, missing values)\n- Distribution plots for key numerical variables\n- Correlation analysis\n- Price analysis by different categorical variables\n- Any interesting patterns or anomalies you discovered\n\nWrite a 1-page executive summary (300-400 words) that you would present to a stakeholder who doesn't know anything about data science. Explain:\n\n- What the dataset contains\n- Key findings from your analysis\n- What factors seem most important in determining house prices\n- Any data quality issues or limitations\n- Recommendations for next steps\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n- The prompt(s) you used\n- All visualizations in your EDA report\n- Your executive summary\n- Reflection: How did using AI change your approach to this comprehensive analysis compared to doing it by hand?\n\n---\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmit a ZIP file containing one folder for each problem. Within each folder you should have one file for each of the following:\n\n1. **Code files:** All `.py` files or Jupyter notebooks\n2. **Visualizations folder:** All plots and charts generated\n3. **Written responses:** A single document (PDF or Markdown) with all your written answers, interpretations, and AI prompts used\n4. **Data:** Include your cleaned/modified datasets if you created any\n\n---\n\n## Tips for Success\n\n- Write specific, detailed prompts\n- If the AI's first attempt isn't quite right, refine your prompt\n- Always review and test the AI-generated code\n- Don't just accept AI output—understand what it's doing\n- Include context in your prompts (e.g., \"I'm working with a housing dataset with columns...\")\n\n### General:\n\n- Start early—EDA often reveals unexpected issues that take time to address\n- Your interpretations are just as important as your code\n- If you find something interesting in the data, explore it further!\n- Use your brain. That's what it's there for.\n\n",
