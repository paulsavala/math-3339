Part A should be completed **without AI assistance** to build your foundational understanding of regression models, diagnostics, and regularization. Part B should be completed **with AI assistance** (like Gemini CLI) to practice comprehensive model selection and diagnostic analysis at scale.\n\nFor all questions, submit:\n\n1. Your code (in a `.py` file or Jupyter notebook)\n2. All visualizations generated\n3. Written answers to interpretation questions (can be in markdown or comments)\n4. For Part B: Include the prompts you used with the AI assistant\n\n### Datasets\n\nYou'll be working with three datasets:\n\n**Dataset 1:** `real_estate.csv` - Real estate pricing data with columns:\n\n- `price`: Sale price in dollars (TARGET)\n- `sqft`: Square footage\n- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms\n- `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms\n- `age`: Age of property in years\n- `distance_downtown`: Distance to downtown in miles\n- `crime_rate`: Neighborhood crime rate\n- `school_rating`: Local school rating (1-10)\n\n**Dataset 2:** `advertising.csv` - Advertising budget and sales data with columns:\n\n- `sales`: Product sales in thousands (TARGET)\n- `tv`: TV advertising budget in thousands\n- `radio`: Radio advertising budget in thousands\n- `newspaper`: Newspaper advertising budget in thousands\n\n**Dataset 3:** `employee_performance.csv` - Employee metrics with multicollinearity with columns:\n\n- `performance_score`: Performance rating (TARGET)\n- `years_experience`: Years of experience\n- `training_hours`: Hours of training completed\n- `projects_completed`: Number of projects completed\n- `months_employed`: Months with company (highly correlated with years_experience)\n- `certifications`: Number of certifications\n\n---\n\n## Part A: By Hand (No AI Assistance)\n\nComplete questions 1-10 without using AI coding assistants. The goal is to build your foundational understanding of regression diagnostics and regularization.\n\n### Question 1 (4 points)\n\nLoad the `advertising.csv` dataset and fit a Linear Regression model to predict `sales` using all three advertising channels.\n\na) Extract and display the coefficients for each feature\n\nb) Interpret each coefficient in plain language (e.g., \"For every additional thousand dollars spent on TV advertising, sales increase by...\")\n\nc) Which advertising channel has the strongest impact on sales?\n\nd) Calculate R² for this model. What does this value tell you about the model's performance?\n\n---\n\n### Question 2 (5 points)\n\nContinuing with the advertising dataset, manually calculate the following for your linear regression model:\n\na) Calculate the residuals (actual - predicted) for the first 5 data points\n\nb) Compute the Mean Squared Error (MSE) manually from all residuals\n\nc) Compute the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) manually from all residuals\n\nd) Verify your calculations match sklearn's `mean_squared_error` and `mean_absolute_error`\n\ne) Which metric (MSE or MAE) is more sensitive to outliers? Why?\n\n---\n\n### Question 3 (5 points)\n\nCreate diagnostic plots for the linear regression model from Question 1:\n\na) Create a scatter plot of residuals vs. fitted values (predictions)\n\nb) Add a horizontal line at y=0\n\nc) What pattern would you expect to see if the model assumptions are satisfied?\n\nd) Do you observe any concerning patterns in your plot? What might they indicate?\n\ne) Create a histogram of the residuals. Do they appear approximately normally distributed?\n\n---\n\n### Question 4 (5 points)\n\nLoad the `real_estate.csv` dataset.

Which model has the smallest coefficient magnitudes?\n\n---\n\n### Question 6 (4 points)\n\nExplain in your own words (3-4 sentences each):\n\na) What is the purpose of regularization in regression? When would you choose to use it?\n\nb) What is the difference between Ridge (L2) and Lasso (L1) regularization?\n\nc) Why might Lasso set some coefficients to exactly zero while Ridge does not?\n\nd) In what situation would you prefer Lasso over Ridge?\n\n---\n\n### Question 7 (5 points)\n\nUsing the `advertising.csv` dataset, create polynomial features of degree 2 for the `tv` feature only.\n\na) Use `PolynomialFeatures(degree=2, include_bias=False)` to create polynomial features\n\nb) Fit a Linear Regression model using the original features plus the polynomial features of TV\n\nc) Compare R² with the original linear model (without polynomial features)\n\nd) Did adding polynomial features improve performance? Why might this be the case?\n\ne) Plot sales vs. TV budget, showing both the linear and polynomial model predictions\n\n---\n\n### Question 8 (4 points)\n\nYou fit a linear regression model and observe the following residual plot:\n\n- For low fitted values: residuals are mostly positive\n- For medium fitted values: residuals are mostly negative\n- For high fitted values: residuals are mostly positive\n\na) What assumption of linear regression might be violated?\n\nb) What does this pattern suggest about the relationship between features and target?\n\nc) Suggest two approaches to address this issue.\n\n---\n\n### Question 9 (4 points)\n\nUsing the `employee_performance.csv` dataset, fit a Ridge regression model with alpha=10.0.\n\na) Split data into train/test (80/20, random_state=42)\n\nb) Fit the model and calculate train R² and test R²\n\nc) Now fit Ridge models with alpha values: [0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0]\n\nd) For each alpha, record the test R². Which alpha gives the best test performance?\n\ne) What happens to the coefficients as alpha increases?\n\n---\n\n### Question 10 (4 points)\n\nWrite a function called `plot_residual_diagnostics` that:\n\n- Takes a fitted model, X_test, and y_test as inputs\n- Calculates residuals\n- Creates two plots side by side: (1) residuals vs fitted values, (2) histogram of residuals\n- Returns the residuals array\n\nTest your function on a linear regression model fitted to the advertising dataset.\n\nBased on the plots, do the residuals appear randomly distributed?
