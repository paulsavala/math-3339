        "4. Once you have a plan, give it back to the LLM, and ask it to create the steps that it will go through in creating this game. Again, _we don't want it to write any code yet!_ All we want is a detailed plan.\n",
        "5. Once your plan is complete, ask your LLM to do the first step (from the steps determined in what you just did). Test it out! Does it run? Does anything work? Be as critical as possible to make sure things are how you want. Once you've got that completed, move on to the next step.\n"
